# Decorators and Closures
# In Python, decorators let us extend or modify a function’s behavior
# without changing the function itself.
# A decorator takes a function as input and returns a new version of that function.

# Decorators commonly use closures.
# A closure is a function that remembers values from the environment
# where it was created.

# A closure typically has:
# - A function defined inside another function (a nested function)
# - The inner function referencing variables from the outer function
# - The outer function returning the inner function

# A closure becomes a decorator when it takes a function as an argument
# and returns a modified version of that function.
