# OOP Activity: Animals
# Deliverables:
# 1. Create a class named Animal that stores a name and implements a speak() method that returns a generic animal sound.
# 2. Extend Animal by adding a method named describe() that returns a dictionary containing the animal’s name.
# 3. Create a subclass named Dog that inherits from Animal without redefining __init__.
# 4. Add a method named bark() to Dog that returns a dog-specific sound.
# 5. Override the speak() method in Dog so it uses the parent speak() method and adds the dog’s bark to it.
# 6. Test your code by creating an Animal and a Dog, calling speak() on both, and printing the results.
# (Optional) Add Python type hints and docstrings to all classes and methods.
